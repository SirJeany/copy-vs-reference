    let name2 = name

    name = 'Aimee'
    console.log(name, name2)

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players
    console.log(players, team)

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux'
    console.log('team = ', team) // Cool..
    console.log('players = ', players) // Wow - players also gets updated

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way: array.slice()
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[3] = 'Poppy'

    console.log('team2 = ', team2)
    console.log('players = ', players)

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players) //concat players into empty array

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players] // Spreads every iterable/item of players into the container - in this case an array, but it could also be spread into a function...

    // or: Array.from(_copiedArray)
    const team5 = Array.from(players)

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    let captain = person
    captain.age = 70

    console.log('person = ', person)

    // how do we take a copy instead? let copyObj = Object.assign({}, _copiedObject, { updated_prop: new_val })
    let captain2 = Object.assign({id: 32}, person, { name: 'Captain Wes', age: '77' })

    console.log('person = ',  person)
    console.log('captain2 = ',  captain2)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // let captain3 = {...person}

    console.clear()
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    // For a deep copy we can look online for a JS function. 

    // OR: JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(copied_Object)) -> I feel like this is a lot like using array.splice()

    jeanCpy2.social.insta = 'Kingsa'

    console.log('jean.social = ', jean.social)

    // This is the 'poor mans deep clone' -> has some performance issues,
    // SO guess we shouldnt use with many objects in a for loop or such.
